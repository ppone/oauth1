This is a simple OAuth 1 client library. You must have an existing access token to use it—it doesn't
(yet?) handle the authorization phase, because I didn't need that for my larger project. Here's a
simple example:

package main

import (
  "http"
  "oauth1"
)

func main() {
  client := new(http.Client)
  token := oauth1.NewAccessToken("consumer key", "consumer secret", "token", "token secret")

  request, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/home_timeline.json", nil)
  if err == nil {
    token.SignRequestQuery(request)
    response, err := client.Do(request)

…and so on. SignRequestQuery adds the OAuth parameters to the query component of the request URL.
If you'd prefer to use an Authorization header instead, use SignRequestHeader.

Finally, I should note that this is my first real Go code. There are undoubtedly mistakes and
inefficiencies. :)
